# Lattice QCD Exercises
Exercises and sample solutions for the 2017 Autumn semester course [Introduction to Lattice QCD](http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/lerneinheitPre.do?semkez=2017W&lerneinheitId=116315&lang=en) at ETH Zurich.

For each exercise a sample C++ code to perform the simulation is provided, along with a jupyter python notebook where the resulting data is analysed and displayed.
